/*
Edge cases when a manually started stage has an off-nominal delta to target:
1. Wrong direction (skip)
  - Affects: ATTACK, DECAY
    - "High attack interrupted by low attack"
      - NoteOn with high peak
      - ATTACK interrupted by early NoteOff
      - EARLY_RELEASE interrupted by NoteOn with a peak level below current value
    - Inverted decay, if peak level is below sustain level
    - In general, delta from actual value to target has different sign than delta from nominal start value to target
      - I.e., we seem to have already passed the target
  - Solution
    - ATTACK has wrong direction: skip to DECAY
    - DECAY has wrong direction: this is more ambiguous
      - Should we just disallow peak < sustain?
2. Value too far from target (prelude)
  - Affects: DECAY, RELEASE
    - Primary case: NoteOff before SUSTAIN stage has started
    - Can also apply to decay start, e.g.:
      - "High attack interrupted by low attack" causes ATTACK to skip to DECAY
      - ATTACK skips to decay
      - DECAY is now further from sustain level than expected
  - Solution: prelude
    - Populate the stage's expo slopes
    - Extend the stage's initial/steepest slope backward in time
    - Give each Motion a new counter of prelude samples remaining
      - While these count down, use the first expo slope value only
      - See calculation for release_prelude_.samples_left
3. Value too close to target
  - Affects: ATTACK, RELEASE
    - NoteOff from below sustain level
    - NoteOn when above minimum level
  - Solution: truncate beginning of phase
    - Want to skip forward in phase
    - Translating "value too close" to a phase is nonlinear due to expo slope
      - Use LUT that translates an expo value to a phase?

    Slope calculation methods, from most accurate/slow to least:
    1. 2 mults per edge: calculate a scaled expo endpoint for each edge (1 mult) and a delta from the last endpoint, then calculate a slope from the delta (1 mult)
    2. 1 mult per edge: scale linear slope via LUT of ratios in 3.13 or 2.14 format 
    4. 0 mults per edge: if function has a constant 2nd derivative, generate a single scaled number that is *added* to the slope each slice, e.g. -xÂ² + 2x
