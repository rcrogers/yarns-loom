/*
Edge cases when a manually started stage has an off-nominal delta to target:
1. Wrong direction (skip)
  - Affects: ATTACK, DECAY
    - "High attack interrupted by low attack"
      - NoteOn with high peak
      - ATTACK interrupted by early NoteOff
      - EARLY_RELEASE interrupted by NoteOn with a peak level below current value
    - Inverted decay, if peak level is below sustain level
    - In general, delta from actual value to target has different sign than delta from nominal start value to target
      - I.e., we seem to have already passed the target
  - Solution
    - ATTACK has wrong direction: skip to DECAY
    - DECAY has wrong direction: this is more ambiguous
      - Should we just disallow peak < sustain?
2. Value too far from target (prelude)
  - Affects: DECAY, RELEASE
    - Primary case: NoteOff before SUSTAIN stage has started
    - Can also apply to decay start, e.g.:
      - "High attack interrupted by low attack" causes ATTACK to skip to DECAY
      - ATTACK skips to decay
      - DECAY is now further from sustain level than expected
  - Solution: prelude
    - Populate the stage's expo slopes
    - Extend the stage's initial/steepest slope backward in time
    - Give each Motion a new counter of prelude samples remaining
      - While these count down, use the first expo slope value only
      - See calculation for release_prelude_.samples_left
3. Value too close to target
  - Affects: ATTACK, RELEASE
    - NoteOff from below sustain level
    - NoteOn when above minimum level
  - Solution: truncate beginning of phase
    - Want to skip forward in phase
    - Translating "value too close" to a phase is nonlinear due to expo slope
      - Use LUT that translates an expo value to a phase?

/* Render TODO

Try copying expo slope to local

Separate inline buffer of length 4-8?
Write to output buffer 4 samples at a time?

Try outputting slopes instead, then computing a running total
https://claude.ai/chat/127cae75-04b9-4d95-87ac-d01114bd7cf3
Complication: shifting slopes to 16-bit before summing will cause error
Running total must be 32-bit, slope vector must be 32-bit, output buffer can be 16-bit

Options for vector accumulator:
1. Offset slope vector
  - Render buffer of envelope slopes
    - Have to handle corners
  - Offset envelope slope buffer by interpolator slope
  - Compute prefix sum of slope buffer
2. Apply slope/value bias inline, like an idiot
  - Optionally MAKE_BIASED_EXPO_SLOPES
3. Sum 2 q15 vectors
  - Render buffer of interpolator values (with prefix sum?)
  - Sum interpolator value buffer with envelope buffer
4. In-place addition on single buffer
  - Render buffer of interpolator values (with prefix sum?)
  - In render loop, SatAdd with envelope value (into same buffer)
